## ToDo List

An Iron Yard project. We created a basic to-do list that lets the user add/delete tasks and mark them completed. It also keeps a running total of complete and total tasks at the bottom.


How to use it:

-Clone my repo

-Run npm install

-Run bower install

We used jQuery and Underscore libraries.
